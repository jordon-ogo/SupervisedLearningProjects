# ANN
  - The ANN system takes an input of a group of people. It compares their age, credit score, geography, gender, salary, and more to determine if a bank sahould grant this person a loan. After learning the sample size, it provides the accuracy of its predictions. Run the "ann.py" file.
# CNN
  - The database the CNN uses to learn is too large to upload to github. If you are interested in training the CNN, here is a download link for the database. Put it in the same directory as the rest of the files. Depending on how powerful your computer is, it could take a long time to train it.
# RNN
  - The RNN tries to predict the future stock of Google based on how well it has done in the past.
Put dataset directly into "Convolutional Neural Network" folder

# Installation
  - To run these A.I. systems, you will need to install Theano, TensorFlow and Keras. A pdf is included to help guide you with these installations.
